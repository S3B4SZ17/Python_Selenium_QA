# Python_Selenium_QA

### Excersie expectations

The goal of this project is testing the following log-in webpage https://app.sysdigcloud.com/#/login

### Prerequisites

First we need to install the Selenium framework: \
`pip3 install selenium`
We can confirm the installation like this:

```bash
pip3 list | grep selenium
selenium                      4.2.0
```

Then we will need a web driver, in this case I will be using Chrome to make the test, so the Chrome Web Driver. The link is in the following [page](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
